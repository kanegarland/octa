            <h3>What do both parties agree to?</h3>
            <p>You: You have the authority to enter into this contract on behalf of yourself, your company or your organisation. You’ll give us the assets and information we tell you we need to complete the project. You’ll do this when we ask and provide it in the formats we ask for. You’ll review our work, provide feedback and approval in a timely manner too. Deadlines work two ways, so you’ll also be bound by dates we set together. You also agree to stick to the payment schedule set out at the end of this contract.</p>
            <p>Us: We have the experience and ability to do everything we’ve agreed with you and we’ll do it all in a professional and timely manner. We’ll endeavour to meet every deadline that’s set and on top of that we&#x27;ll maintain the confidentiality of everything you give us.</p>
            <h3>Design</h3>
            <p>We create designs that adapt to the capabilities of many devices and screen sizes. We create them iteratively and use predominantly HTML and CSS so we won’t waste time mocking up every template as a static visual. We may use visuals to indicate a creative direction (colour, texture and typography.) You’ll have plenty of opportunities to review our work and provide feedback. We’ll share a development site with you and we’ll have regular contact by either phone or email. If—at any stage—you change your mind about what you want delivered or aren’t happy with the direction our work is taking, we will discuss these options  you’ll pay us in full for the time we’ve spent working until that point and may terminate this contract.</p>
            <h3>Text content</h3>
            <p>We do provide basic copywriting as standard. We also provide professional copywriting and editing services, so if you’d like us to create new content or input content for you, we’ll provide a separate estimate. We do provide basic copywriting as standard, We’re not responsible for the content such as text or images into your website.</p>
            <h3>Graphics and photographs</h3>
            <p>You should supply graphic files in an editable, vector digital format. You should supply photographs in a high resolution digital format. If you choose to buy stock photographs, we can suggest stock libraries. If you’d like us to search for photographs for you, we can provide a separate estimate.</p>
            <h3>HTML, CSS and JavaScript</h3>
            <p>We deliver pages developed from HTML markup, CSS stylesheets for styling and unobtrusive JavaScript for behaviours.</p>
            <h3>Browser testing</h3>
            <p>Browser testing no longer means attempting to make a website look the same in browsers of different capabilities or on devices with different size screens. It does mean ensuring that a person’s experience of a design should be appropriate to the capabilities of a browser or device.</p>
            <p>We test our work in current versions of major desktop browsers including those made by Apple (Safari), Google (Chrome), Microsoft (Edge), Mozilla Firefox and Opera. We won’t test in other older browsers unless we agreed separately. If you need an enhanced design for an older browser, we can provide a separate estimate for that.</p>
            <h3>Mobile browser testing</h3>
            <p>Testing using popular smaller screen devices is essential in ensuring that a person’s experience of a design is appropriate to the capabilities of the device they’re using. We test our designs in: iOS: Safari and Google Chrome Android: Google Chrome We won’t test in Opera Mini/Mobile, specific Android devices, or other mobile browsers unless we agreed separately. If you need us to test using these, we can provide a separate estimate.</p>
            <h3>Technical support</h3>
            <p>We’re not a website hosting company so we don’t offer support for website hosting, email or other services relating to hosting but we will provide guidance when needed. You may already have professional hosting and you might even manage that hosting in-house; if you do, great. If you don’t, we will recommend one of our preferred hosting providers such as GoDaddy. We can set up your site on a server, plus any statistics software such as Google Analytics. Management of that server will be up to you and we cannot be held responsible..</p>
            <h3>Search engine optimisation (SEO)</h3>
            <p>We don’t guarantee improvements to your website’s search engine ranking, but the pages that we develop are accessible to search engines and have all the correct information for search engines to rank properly.</p>
            <h3>Changes and revisions</h3>
            <p>We don’t want to limit your ability to change your mind. The price at the beginning of this contract is based on the number of weeks that we estimate we’ll need to accomplish everything you’ve told us you want to achieve, but we’re happy to be flexible. If you want to change your mind or add anything new after completion, that won’t be a problem as we’ll provide a separate estimate for those additional times.</p>
            <h3>Legal stuff</h3>
            <p>We’ll carry out our work in accordance with good industry practice and at the standard expected from a suitably qualified person with relevant experience. That said, we can’t guarantee that our work will be error-free and so we can’t be liable to you or any third-party for damages, including lost profits, lost savings or other incidental, consequential or special damages, even if you’ve advised us of them.</p>
            <p><br></p>
            <p>Your liability to us will also be limited to the amount of fees payable under this contract and you won’t be liable to us or any third-party for damages, including lost profits, lost savings or other incidental, consequential or special damages, even if we’ve advised you of them.</p>
            <p>Finally, if any provision of this contract shall be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from this contract and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.</p>
            <h3>Intellectual property rights</h3>
            <p>Just to be clear, “Intellectual property rights” means all patents, rights to inventions, copyright (including rights in software) and related rights, trademarks, service marks, get up and trade names, internet domain names, rights to goodwill or to sue for passing off, rights in designs, database rights, rights in confidential information (including know-how) and any other intellectual property rights, in each case whether registered or unregistered and including all applications (or rights to apply) for, and renewals or extensions of such rights and all similar or equivalent rights or forms of protection which subsist or shall subsist now or in the future in any part of the world.</p>
            <p>First, you guarantee that all elements of text, images or other artwork you provide are either owned by your good selves, or that you have permission to use them. When you provide text, images or other artwork to us, you agree to protect us from any claim by a third party that we’re using their intellectual property.</p>
            <p>We guarantee that all elements of the work we deliver to you are either owned by us or we’ve obtained permission to provide them to you. When we provide text, images or other artwork to you, we agree to protect you from any claim by a third party that you’re using their intellectual property. Provided you’ve paid for the work and that this contract hasn’t been terminated, we’ll assign all intellectual property rights to you as follows:</p>
            <p>You’ll own the website we design for you plus the visual elements that we create for it. We’ll give you source files and finished files and you should keep them somewhere safe as we’re not required to keep a copy. You own all intellectual property rights of text, images, site specification and data you provided, unless someone else owns them.</p>
            <p><br></p>
            <p>We’ll own any intellectual property rights we’ve developed prior to, or developed separately from this project and not paid for by you. We’ll own the unique combination of these elements that constitutes a complete design and we’ll license its use to you, exclusively and in perpetuity for this project only, unless we agree otherwise.</p>
            <h3>Displaying our work</h3>
            <p>We love to show off our work, so we reserve the right to display all aspects of our creative work, including sketches, work-in-progress designs and the completed project on our portfolio and in articles on websites, in magazine articles and in books.</p>
            <h3>Payment schedule</h3>
            <p>We’re sure you understand how important it is as a small business that you pay the invoices that we send you promptly. As we’re also sure you’ll want to stay friends, you agree to stick tight to the payment schedule provided. We issue invoices electronically. Our payment terms are 14 days from the date of invoice by BACS (Bank Transfer).. All proposals are quoted in GBP Sterling £ and payments will be made at the equivalent conversion rate at the date the transfer is made.</p>
            <p>You agree to pay all charges associated with international transfers of funds. The appropriate bank account details will be printed on our electronic invoice. We reserve the right to charge interest on all overdue debts at the rate of [percentage] per month or part of a month.</p>
            <p>We both agree that we’ll adhere to all relevant laws and regulations in relation to our activities under this contract and not cause the other to breach any relevant laws or regulations.</p>
            <p>This contract stays in place and need not be renewed. If for some reason one part of this contract becomes invalid or unenforceable, the remaining parts of it remain in place.</p>
            <p>Although the language is simple, the intentions are serious and this contract is a legal document under exclusive jurisdiction of English and Welsh courts.</p>

            <h3>8. RELATIONSHIP OF THE PARTIES</h3>
            <p>8.1 Independent Contractor. Designer is an independent contractor, not an employee of Client or any company affiliated with Client. Designer shall provide the Services under the general direction of Client, but Designer shall determine, in Designer’s sole discretion, the manner and means by which the Services are accomplished. This Agreement does not create a partnership or joint venture and neither party is authorized to act as agent or bind the other party except as expressly stated in this Agreement. Designer and the work product or Deliverables prepared by Designer shall not be deemed a work for hire as that term is defined under Copyright Law. All rights, if any, granted to Client are contractual in nature and are wholly defined by the express written agreement of the parties and the various terms and conditions of this Agreement.</p>
